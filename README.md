# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Using-Metaheuristic-Algorithms-

## INTRODUCTION:
Vehicle Routing Problem is a generalization of the Travelling Salesman problem. There 
are nodes which represent customers/delivery spots/end points and a depot. Each 
customer position is defined on a planar surface and the distance to this point is known. 
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem that 
belongs to the NP-complete class.
